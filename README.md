# kapow-builds
Most mined kawpaw coins builds for linux (deb/ubuntu and based distros)

# Available scripts
meowcoin
neoxa
clore
paprikacoin

I decided to work around the original scripts on doc/build_with_db 4_linux.sh once the binary release doesn't work for me. 
I noticed the only files on that releases was like 3 binaries but the statics and dinamics libs needed (and many other files)
for run the program are not present on it.
